Appendix A is a list of optimization techniques extracted from the literature,
organized by the themes provided in the main paper.

Appendix A goes into much greater detail about the techniques listed and references
exactly which papers provided which contributions to understanding and implementing
the techniques.

I'm not sure how to summarize the 40 pages of Appendix A in 1 page, but I am very thankful that it was provided as a reference, and I will be keeping note of it for my future work
and sharing it with others who need to perform CUDA optimizations.
