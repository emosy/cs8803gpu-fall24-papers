// This week's paper topic is accelerating graph using CUDA.
// [1] option 1:

// Scalable gpu graph traversal, (https://research.nvidia.com/sites/default/files/pubs/2012-02_Scalable-GPU-Graph/ppo213s-merrill.pdf)

// Provide a short summary of the paper.
// Discuss the performance optimization techniques in terms of compute/memory.
// Explain what is linear parallelization in this paper.

// [2] option 2:

// If you think the paper requires too much background knowledge, choose any of the references in the paper or

// https://cdn.iiit.ac.in/cdn/cvit.iiit.ac.in/images/ConferencePapers/2007/Pawan07accelerating.pdf
// or other materials on running graph algorithms on CUDA.
// Please provide a short summary of how GPUs have been used for accelerating graph algorithms.
